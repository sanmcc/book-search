## User Story

AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

## Description

Used starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
